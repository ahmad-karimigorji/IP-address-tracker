# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution
## About The Project:
In this project, you can get its information using IP address or domain. To get the IP Address locations, I use the IP Geolocation API by IPify.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex
- CSS Grid
- IPify ([geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/))
- Leaflet ([map API](https://leafletjs.com/))
